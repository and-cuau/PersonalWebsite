# Personal Website

This is a personal website designed to display my background and my projects.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Features & Functionality

- **Routing**: Implements dynamic routing using React Router to navigate between different pages of the app.
- **Components**: Utilizes React components to build reusable UI elements. Each page and feature is encapsulated in its own component, improving maintainability and readability of the code.
- **Passing Props**: Components communicate and share data through props, allowing for dynamic content rendering and a smooth user experience. For example, the main page component passes data to child components to display relevant content.
- **Carousel**: Includes an interactive carousel component to showcase images or items in a sliding format, providing a visually engaging user interface.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge**: Ensuring consistent top-center positioning of the navigation bar across pages.  
  **Solution**: Changed CSS positioning from "absolute" to "fixed".

## Future Improvements

- Plan to implement CSS media queries to fit pages to additional screen sizes.
